Project 2 - Game
the names of all team members: Jake Liebow
a description of your goals: Create a fun interactive game utilizing machine learning.
tools used: Wekinator, P5
ML choices you made. Provide evaluation data (e.g. performance comparisons with other algorithms) showing why the ML algorithm and parameters you used were the right ones: I haven't implemented the machine learning video controls yet.
overview of what you accomplished: The base game is set up in P5.
what technical and creative challenges you had to overcome and how you did so (e.g. if you experimented with different approaches to feature modeling, provide data documenting this): The biggest challenge so far has been getting P5 to work on my computer nativley, so that I can implement OSC into it. I overcame this through research and eventually found an option outside of the Processing framework.
an explanation of what you think you learned in the project: I've learned quite a bit about classification and regression at least in planning out how I am going to capture my inputs and build viable controls with them, this is a very helpful experience.
